/**
 * Gear joint: enforces a rotation ratio between two revolute/prismatic joints.
 *
 * The gear joint couples two existing constraints (typically HingeJoint2D or
 * SliderJoint2D) so that the rotation/translation of one drives the other
 * at a fixed ratio: `θ_A + ratio × θ_B = constant`.
 *
 * ## Reference resolution strategy
 *
 * The solver requires `constraintIdA` and `constraintIdB` — the runtime IDs
 * of the two coupled constraints. Exposing raw IDs as serialisable properties
 * is fragile: prefab instantiation and scene reload regenerate IDs, breaking
 * saved references.
 *
 * **This component accepts `Joint2D` component references** (`jointA`, `jointB`)
 * and resolves their `constraintId` at runtime. This survives prefab/scene
 * ID regeneration because component references are resolved by entity
 * relationship, not by persisted numeric ID.
 *
 * ### Ordering / deferred creation
 *
 * The referenced joints must have created their constraints before the gear
 * joint can resolve. If `start()` runs before the referenced joints have
 * called `createConstraint()`, the gear joint enters a **pending state**
 * (`isPending === true`) and retries resolution on the next `fixedUpdate()`.
 * Resolution is also re-attempted when `jointA`/`jointB` setters fire.
 *
 * If resolution still fails after a configurable grace period (checked via
 * `tryResolve()`), the component logs a warning — it does NOT throw, because
 * the referenced joint may be disabled or misconfigured, and a hard error
 * would prevent the rest of the scene from loading.
 *
 * ### Reference serialisation contract (Editor ↔ Engine)
 *
 * `jointA` and `jointB` are stored as **strings** in the Editor (entity/component
 * IDs), with `""` meaning "no reference". The engine stores them as `Joint2D | null`.
 *
 * - `serialize()` emits `""` for both fields (references are managed by the
 *   scene loader, not by the component's own serialiser).
 * - `deserialize()` normalises `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and whitespace-only
 *   strings to `null`. A `null` reference means "no joint coupled" — the gear
 *   constraint is NOT created and `isPending` stays `false`. This is distinct
 *   from the pending state, which only activates when non-null references are
 *   provided but their constraints haven't been created yet.
 * - Use the inherited `normalizeReferenceValue()` helper for this rule.
 *
 * **Units** (METRE campaign):
 * - `ratio` — dimensionless (radians per radian, or metres per radian)
 *
 * Maps to solver `Gear` case.
 * **Solver**: FULL — rotation ratio enforcement.
