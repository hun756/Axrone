 * - `match-width`: Scale uniformly so that the canvas width matches the viewport width.
 *   Height may be cropped or letterboxed.
 * - `match-height`: Scale uniformly so that the canvas height matches the viewport height.
 *   Width may be cropped or letterboxed.
 * - `match-width-or-height`: Scale uniformly using a bias between width and height matching.
 *   A `matchBias` of 0 behaves like `match-width`; 1 behaves like `match-height`.
 * - `fill`: Scale non-uniformly so the canvas exactly fills the viewport (may stretch).
 * - `fixed`: No scaling (1:1 pixel mapping), centered with possible letterboxing.
