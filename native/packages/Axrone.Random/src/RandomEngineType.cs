/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Values are permanent.</b> The numeric value of a member is its serialized form, so
/// members may be appended but never reordered, renumbered or removed. The explicit assignments
/// make the wire contract visible in the source.</para>
/// <para><b>Storage is a byte, deliberately.</b> CA1028 asks for an int, but this tag travels
/// through serialized scene files, save files and command lines, where a one-byte field is the
/// difference between a readable record and a padded word - and the underlying values are
/// compared as bytes anyway. The rule is suppressed here rather than project-wide, so it stays
/// visible that the storage width is a decision rather than an oversight.</para>
/// <para><b>No factory, on purpose.</b> There is deliberately no
/// <c>CreateSource(RandomEngineType, ulong)</c> here. Every hot draw goes through the generic,
/// fully inlined <see cref="RandomEngine{TEngine}"/>, and any factory that could turn this tag
/// into a live stream would have to box the value-type engine, hide the static-abstract
/// dispatch behind an interface call, or return a delegate that allocates - all three put a
/// virtual call or a heap object in front of a multiply. Configuration code that already knows
/// which engine it wants calls <c>TEngine.Create(seed)</c> directly with its own concrete type,
/// and a genuinely data-driven caller switches on the tag once, outside the draw loop. A factory
/// belongs to whichever layer owns the plumbing, not to this package.</para>
